For my project I made asteroids based of the game from 1980
Its mostly similar except for a variation I made, normally you have a button that teleports you to a random location
I thought this was kinda boring so instead there is a shield that pushes asteroids away and reflects shots back at ufos
Instructions for controls and how the game works are in the game


--important--
if your setting this up the scores text file should be in the asteroids package, otherwise it wont be able to find the file
