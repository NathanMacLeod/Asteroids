# Asteroids
Project for my first semester AP Computer Science class. I tried to recreate the arcade game Asteroids. Made around November 2017

I tried to be pretty faithful to the original game, although I replaced the teleport with a shield that allows you to reflect enemy projectiles and push away asteroids to avoid collisions
